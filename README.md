# Timed Coding Quiz
## Creating a timed coding quiz using Javascript

-- Overview 
Creating a coding quiz implementing Javascript.
This will create a timed quiz that also penalizes the user for incorrect answers.
Also saving all high scores into a local storage to view at a later time during the game.

### The Challenge:
Creating a timed quiz using Javascript that creates a timed session for a user to answer the questions.
If any question is answered incorrectly the timer must penalize by 5 seconds. At the end of the game their score will
be the time they had left. They will have the option to save their high score in a local storage to view.

### User Story: 
"S A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers"

### Acceptance Criteria:
"GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score"

## My Process:
Create my layout using HTML and CSS. Then adding in different buttons that allow the game to begin. 
I then added functions that allow the user to view the questions and answers. At the end of the game they will have the option 
to submit and save their score along with their name,

### Built With:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### What I Learned:
I learned how to create functions to target different things on the page. Learningg how to create a timer and using that to tie in with the users high score. 
Also, learned how to create a local storage to save the high score of the player.
